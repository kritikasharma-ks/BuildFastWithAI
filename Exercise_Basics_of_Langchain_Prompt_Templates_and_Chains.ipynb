            "#### Ingredients:\n",
            "- 1 ½ cups Arborio rice\n",
            "- 6 cups vegetable broth (low-sodium)\n",
            "- 1 cup white wine (optional, or use additional broth)\n",
            "- 1 medium onion, finely chopped\n",
            "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
            "- 8 oz (about 225g) mushrooms, sliced (cremini, shiitake, or your choice)\n",
            "- 1 cup frozen peas (optional)\n",
            "- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n",
            "- 1 tablespoon vegan butter (optional for added creaminess)\n",
            "- ½ cup nutritional yeast (for a cheesy flavor)\n",
            "- Salt and pepper, to taste\n",
            "- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n",
            "- Lemon zest (optional, for added brightness)\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Instructions:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Prepare the Broth**: In a saucepan, heat the vegetable broth over low heat and keep it warm throughout the cooking process.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Sauté Aromatics**: In a large skillet or pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Cook the Mushrooms**: Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they are softened and browned, about 5-7 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Toast the Rice**: Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and stir well to coat the rice with the oil and mix it with the mushrooms and onions. Cook for about 2 minutes until the rice is slightly toasted.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Add Wine**: If using, pour in the white wine and stir until it has mostly evaporated. This will add depth of flavor to your risotto.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Gradually Add Broth**: Begin adding the warm vegetable broth, one ladle at a time. Stir constantly and allow the rice to absorb the broth before adding more. This process should take about 18-20 minutes. The risotto is done when the rice is creamy and al dente.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Add Peas and Nutritional Yeast**: When the rice is almost done, stir in the frozen peas (if using) and nutritional yeast. Add the vegan butter for extra creaminess, and mix well. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Garnish and Serve**: Remove from heat and let it sit for a minute. Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley and a sprinkle of lemon zest if desired.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Enjoy!\n",
