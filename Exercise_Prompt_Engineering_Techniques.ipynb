Imagine a heavy ball placed on a rubber sheet; it creates a dip. If you roll a smaller ball near the heavy ball, it will spiral towards it because of the curvature. Similarly, massive objects like planets and stars warp the space around them, and this curvature is what we perceive as gravity.\n",

            "#### Step 4: Incorporate Boiling Water\n",
            "4. Carefully stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin, but this is normal. Mix until everything is well blended.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Step 5: Pour into Pans\n",

            "#### Step 6: Bake\n",

Life, I realized, is not just about the moments we live but the legacies we pass down. Through her lessons, she had taught me how to embrace life fully, and in doing so, she would forever remain a part of me. The cottage may have stood empty, but her love blossomed eternal, like the lilacs that bloomed each spring, reminding me that she would always be my guiding light.\n"
